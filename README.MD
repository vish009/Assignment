## Simplifi App

##### This is a basic application which is interacting with Ethereum Blockchain to read data from a pre-deplyed smart contract on Mainnet.

##### The smart contract is written in app.sol Solidity file.

##### The smart contract is HelloSimplyfi which is already deployed on ethereum address - 0xCd4d315309DB3f95841473a717208747d204d941

##### and it can be viewed on etherscan as -
```
https://etherscan.io/address/0xcd4d315309db3f95841473a717208747d204d941#code
```

##### The app will run by simply starting app.html where Web3 interface communicates with the blockchain directly and gives results according to the values.

##### Start by opening app.html in browser
